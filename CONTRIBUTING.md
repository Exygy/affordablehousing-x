# Contributing to Bloom

Contributions to the core Bloom applications and services are welcomed. To help us meet the project's goals around quality and maintainability, we ask that all contributors read, understand, and agree to these guidelines.

## Reporting an Issue

We use GitHub issues to track both bugs and feature ideas.

## Pull Requests

## Code Style

We use the automatic code formatter Prettier. If you're not using an IDE that integrates with it, you should run yarn prettier on all added or changed code before you submit a pull request.
