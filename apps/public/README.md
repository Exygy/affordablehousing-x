# Public App v0

This is the beginning of the public-facing DAHLIA app.

## Running end-to-end tests locally
* Start the Next.js server: `yarn dev`
* In a separate terminal, open the Cypress app: `yarn run cypress open`
* In the Cypress app, click on the test called "our_first_test.spec.js". This will open the Cypress test runner in a Chrome browser and run the test.
