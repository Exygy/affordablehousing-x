The 2nd-generation Card component is indended to serve as a flexible content container with a header, zero or more content sections, and a footer. Over time our intention is to "port" some other cards and content blocks in the system to use this Card for their underlying structure.

Styles within the DOM tree of Card are intended to set up sensible defaults without requiring the consumer to configure bespoke styling as they author a card. For example, rule lines will be drawn automatically between the various subcomponents within a card, and margin/padding will be set according to top-level variables.

You can author a Card using subcomponents simply by referencing them via the single Card import. For example, `<Card.Header>`, `<Card.Footer>` etc. In the case where you want to create a new type of card, you can import the subcomponents directly as `<CardHeader>`, `<CardFooter>`, etc. and place them in any container. It's still recommended you include the `.card` class on your custom container so you inherit a base set of CSS properties. (See the **Wacky Card** example below.)

Note that the `<Card.Footer>` subcomponent doesn't inherently add rules or padding (so that you can use other components with self-contained styling such as `<ButtonGroup>`. However, you can use `<Card.Section>` within `<Card.Footer>` to add rules and padding.

The `<Card.Header>` subcomponent will typically be paired with a child `<Card.HeadingGroup>` for a title & subtitle grouping, but that's just a pattern not a requirement.
